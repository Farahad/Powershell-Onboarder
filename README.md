# Powershell Onboarder
 My Powershell program for onboarding new computers
 
 This is a work in progress, and as such, things may often be odd or broken. This is also my first project on github, so if something is in the wrong format, please let me know.
 
 When in use, this is compiled into an EXE, I use Visual Studio to edit the manifest file, forcing it to search for an administrator credential.

 Alternatively, you could download the repository, and just use run the powershell from the same folder as the other resources, though I can update that in a future release.

I do plan on rebuilding this into an intuitive C# application, but that has a ways to go.
